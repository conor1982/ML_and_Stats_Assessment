# ML_and_Stats_Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains all the requirements needed for the assessment of the Machine Learning and Statistics module.

The assessment requires two notebooks to be created.

1. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
2. Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook

***

### Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook

#### Overview
This notebook provides an Overview of the Scikit-Learn python libary. Within the notebook, examples of three different algorithims are demonstrated. These are:
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Regression
3. Support Vector Machines

For each algorithim we will through the steps requried to produce a model maximsed to its best performance:

1. Importing Datasets
2. Data preparation - cleaning, exploratory data analysis, scaling, extracting the most important features.
3. Data training - to help the model learn, it needs to be shown data.
4. Evaluating the Model - test the model performance, performance metrics etc.
5. Tuning - fine tune the model with optimal parameters etc. to maximise performance.

To help demonstrate our three examples even further, multiple visulaisations are also included to aid understanding.

### Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook

#### Overview
This notebook provides of an overview of the scipy stats module. The overview, aided by simulating a normally distributed datset will go through some examples of the statistical functions available within the scipy stats module. Furthermore, the notebook will look in depth at two examples of an ANOVA *Analysis of Variance*.

Within the ANOVA, the notebook will go through step by step each of the assumptions requeired to perform an ANOVA and alway the various post-hoc tests taht may also be required.
